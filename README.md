# Important 
The API on which the application is based were created by the University of Milan for the purpose of creating an exam project. 
It is likely that these APIs have been removed and network calls, as a result, do not return any data


<h1>Introduction:</h1>

You have been hired by the Italian startup "eat and that's it" that sells meals at home. There
startup stands out from the competition for its speed of purchase and delivery. In fact, instead
rather than composing menus by choosing various dishes, the user can directly purchase a menu which
it is also delivered to the point from which it was purchased in a very short time by a
drone.

<h1>Eat-Stop</h1>

The specifications of the app have already been described in: https://github.com/GabrieleNicchi/Eat-Stop

This is the same application but in the Kotlin programming language

Some representative screenshots (remember the operation is similar to the project in React):
